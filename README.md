# GNU/Linux config files

This repo is made so I can easily symlink all my config files into needed locations
but from one single well structured location. Configs should be linked with bash
scripts. Scripts are located in the first level of directories and named \_\_symlink.sh.
The plan is to make a bash script that will execute all those bash scripts and they
will link the files. Don't use .configxxx notation for config files in the repo but 
name them without the dot (ex. ".vimrc" will be "vimrc").
